1.) The word frequency did not change. My HashMap is the fastest followed by HashMap, then TreeMap
2.) Math.floorMod rounds down, it maps to the nearest lowest integer essentially it is more reliable for hash table indexs.
3.) The time complexity is O(n). You could make it more efficient by increasing size everytime you add another item.
4.) Both were reliable but linked node class was easier to implement.
